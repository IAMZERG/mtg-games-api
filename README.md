#Welcome to your new Confidant and playtesting buddy

##Todo
1. Polish off authorization/authentication.
2. Clean up the models.
3. Get to work on the front end of the app.
4. Figure out what additional endpoints to support, or make the front-end do all the heavy lifting (makes the most sense since this targets desktops primarily).
6. Open up the API to be flexible enough to handle other games (version 2 territory).
##Planned Endpoints
