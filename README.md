#Welcome to your new Dark Confidant (AKA playtesting guru)!

##Todo
1. Polish off authorization/authentication.
2. Clean up the models.
3. Get to work on the front end of the app.
4. Figure out what additional endpoints to support, or make the front-end do all the heavy lifting (makes the most sense since ths targets desktops primarily).
